    "Multiprocessing is a topic in this course, the focus of which was intended to be multiprocessing with the CPU.  Given the advances in the <code>cupy</code> package recently, a quick tangent to cover this method of multiprocessing on the Graphic Processing Units (GPUs) is worthwhile because some computers are equipped with powerful graphics cards with a multitude of onboard processors.  Although each of these processors is much less powerful than the cores on our CPUs, their power lies in their multitude.  Here are the specs on my NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3090 graphics card:\n",
    "\n",
    "- 10496 computing cores\n",
    "- 24GB memory\n",
    "\n",
    "There is strength in the number of processors.  The GPU memory capacity, 24GB, is less than I have available to my CPU (64GB) and so this is a relative weakness.\n",
    "\n",
    "NVIDA's <code>cuda</code> is used by the <code>cupy</code> package and so only cuda-enabled NVIDIA graphcis card can run <code>cupy</code>: a list of those can be found [here](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-gpus).  You can check to see if your graphics card is listed here.  If it is, then you can run <code>cupy</code>.\n",
    "\n",
    "The programming interface for <code>cupy</code> currently looks just like the <code>numpy</code> interface.  To use <code>cupy</code> use this import statement,\n",
    "\n",
    "``` python\n",
    "import cupy as cp\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "and then use the <code>cp</code> alias as you would <code>np</code>.\n",
